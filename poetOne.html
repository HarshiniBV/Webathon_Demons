        <h2>The Lost Ball</h2>
        <p id="pa">   - John Berryman</p>
        <br>
        <p class="thi">
            What is the boy now, who has lost his ball. <br>
What, what is he to do? I saw it go <br>
Merrily bouncing, down the street, and then<br>
Merrily overâ€”there it is in the water!<br>
No use to say 'O there are other balls':<br>
An ultimate shaking grief fixes the boy<br>
As he stands rigid, trembling, staring down<br>
All his young days into the harbour where<br>
His ball went. I would not intrude on him,<br>
A dime, another ball, is worthless. Now<br>
He senses first responsibility<br>
In a world of possessions. People will take balls,<br>
Balls will be lost always, little boy,<br>
And no one buys a ball back. Money is external.<br>
He is learning, well behind his desperate eyes,<br>
The epistemology of loss, how to stand up<br>
Knowing what every man must one day know<br>
And most know many days, how to stand up<br>
And gradually light returns to the street,<br>
A whistle blows, the ball is out of sight.<br>
Soon part of me will explore the deep and dark<br>
Floor of the harbour . . I am everywhere,<br>
I suffer and move, my mind and my heart move<br>
With all that move me, under the water<br>
Or whistling, I am not a little boy
